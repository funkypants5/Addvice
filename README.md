# Addvice

**Addvice** is a web-based application built using **ReactJS** and **Firebase**, and hosted on **Vercel**.  
The goal of Addvice is to **lower the barrier for mentorship and menteeship**, providing a platform where individuals can easily connect, apply for mentorship, or offer mentorship to others.  
This project is developed as part of **Orbital 2024**, achieving the **Apollo** level.

This also marks my **first experience** working with **ReactJS**, **Firebase**, and **Vercel**.
